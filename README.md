# Helm charts

This repository contains personal helm charts.

## Chart dependencies

For helm chart dependencies the required repository needs to be added.
In case a new dependency repository is needed it should be added to `bin/add-repos`.
Otherwise the workflow will be broken as helm would be unable to build the chart dependencies.

To locally add all necessary repos:

```sh
./bin/add-repos
```
